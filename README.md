# Coding Problems
Various coding problems I've solved that aren't big enough to have their own Repo.
* School projects are problems I worked on in computer science classes in college.
* Project Euler problems are from https://projecteuler.net/.
* The other folders contain categorized problems from various sources -- the attribution is normally in the header docstring.
