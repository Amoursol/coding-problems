# Coding Problems
Various coding problems I've solved that aren't big enough to have their own Repos.
* School projects are problems I worked on in computer science classes in college.
* Code jam problems are solutions to the Google Code Jam competition questions. In the Docstring for the problem it says whether or not I completed the problem within the competition. Note, these are not all of the problems I have solved but just the ones I have cleaned up.
* The other folders contain categorized problems from various sources -- the attribution is normally in the header docstring. 

Note: Many of these are from different time periods and were written in different editors or environments so formatting or code style may be different over the years! For the most part since these are quick problems that I usually won't use again in the exact format, I run them inline in Sublime Text rather than dealing with command line arguments or user inputs.
